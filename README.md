## **BUSINESS UNDERSTANDING**
#### Introduction

Customer churn, also known as customer attrition, refers to the loss of customers. It is the percentage of customers that stopped using your company's product or service during a certain time frame. In our case SyriaTel, a telecommunication company, is encumbered with high customer churn. The company's management therefore desires to understand why they are losing customers and suggestions on what to act on thus increase customer retention rate.

#### Problem Statement

SyriaTel will maintain and increase profitability only if it is able to acquire and retain more customers who use the company's services. High customer churning, if unaddressed, will hurt the company's revenue. It is therefore paramount to draw a targeted strategy that can assist in retaining more customers. We aim to develop a binary classification model that predicts the likelihood of customers withdrawing. The model also endeavor to highlight factors leading to attrition and which should be addressed in priority.

#### Objectives
1. Develop an accurate model for predicting customer churn
2. Identify the factors that significantly affect customer churn
3. Provide valuable insights that could help reduce churn

#### Stakeholders
 * Management Team
 * Marketing Team
provide a high level insights from  of the tuned decision tree model  suggestions how to improve it 
## Conclusions 


This project involved performing feature selection and identifying the top influential features in a machine learning model. We used a grid search to find the best estimator for a DecisionTreeClassifier and extracted feature importances. The top influential features were sorted as displayed.

# Business Recommendations

Summarized advice for handling the top influential features to reduce churn.

1. Based on top  three Features:
    - SyriaTel may consider offering plans with flexible day minutes to cater to different usage patterns. Provide data packages or discounts during peak hours.
    - SyriaTel may ntroduce evening-specific promotions and packages. Encourage customers to use evening minutes for longer calls or special activities like video calls.
    - SyriaTel may similarly focus on reducing the number of customer service calls. Improve self-service options, provide clear FAQs, and offer incentives for issue resolution through other channels.  

2. Focus on Retention Strategies:
    - Identify and target customers with the most influential features that indicate a higher risk of churning.
    - Implement retention strategies such as special offers, loyalty programs, or personalized recommendations to keep these customers engaged.

3. Customer Segmentation:
    - Segment your customer base based on the influential features. This can help tailor marketing efforts and communication to different customer groups.
    - For example, if the top feature is "contract duration," you can create specific marketing campaigns for customers with short-term contracts to encourage them to stay longer.
    

    
    
    
    

4. Feature Enhancement:
    - Improve the features with lower importance but still relevant to reduce churn. These features may have potential for improvement or further analysis.
    - Continuously monitor and update the list of influential features as customer preferences and behaviors change.

5. Monitor and Evaluate:
    - Implement the advised strategies and closely monitor the impact on churn rates.
    - Regularly update the analysis as the business landscape evolves to ensure that your strategies remain effective.
